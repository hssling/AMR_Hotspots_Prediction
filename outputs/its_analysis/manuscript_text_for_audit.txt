Despite international recognition, its impact on antimicrobial resistance (AMR) trends remains unevaluated using national surveillance data. This study aimed to characterize AMR trends during the campaign era (2016-2024) using interrupted time series (ITS) analysis of ICMR-AMRSN surveillance data.\nMethods: We consolidated resistance data from three ICMR-AMRSN datasets (N=120 center-year observations) spanning 2016-2024. Segmented regression was used to model temporal trends in mean resistance percentages for WHO priority pathogens. Sensitivity analyses included pathogen-specific models and COVID-19 period exclusion.\nResults: Mean resistance increased from 14.0% (2016) to 53.5% (2024), with a significant annual increase of 2.51%/year (95% CI: 1.09-3.94, p=0.004). The model explained 71.3% of variance (R²=0.71). Pathogen-specific analyses showed variable trends: E. coli (+1.26%/year, p=0.048), S. aureus MRSA (+2.97%/year, p=0.035), A. baumannii (+6.73%/year, p=0.073), and K. pneumoniae (+0.27%/year, p=0.848). Excluding COVID-19 years strengthened the trend (+3.49%/year, p=0.001).\nInterpretation & Conclusions: Despite the Red Line campaign, AMR rates continued to rise significantly during 2016-2024. While this does not negate campaign effectiveness (given the absence of pre-2016 baseline), the findings underscore the need for multi-pronged interventions beyond awareness campaigns. Enhanced enforcement, antimicrobial stewardship programs, and stronger pharmaceutical regulations are urgently needed.\n\nKeywords: Antimicrobial resistance; Red Line Campaign; India; Interrupted time series; ICMR-AMRSN; Antibiotic stewardship\n\nIntroduction\nAntimicrobial resistance (AMR) represents one of the most pressing global health challenges of the 21st century. The Global Research on Antimicrobial Resistance (GRAM) report estimated that in 2019, 4.95 million deaths were associated with bacterial AMR, with 1.27 million deaths directly attributable to it.¹ South Asia, including India, bears a disproportionate burden of this "silent pandemic."²\nIndia faces a unique convergence of factors contributing to AMR: high infectious disease burden, widespread over-the-counter antibiotic availability, self-medication practices, and variable quality of healthcare services.³ The country consumes more antibiotics than any other nation, with an estimated 13 billion defined daily doses (DDD) annually.⁴ Studies have consistently documented high rates of resistance to commonly used antibiotics, with carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) emerging as critical threats.⁵\nRecognizing this crisis, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare launched the "Red Line" campaign in February 2016. This initiative requires all prescription-only antibiotics (Schedule H and H1 drugs) to be marked with a vertical red line on their packaging, serving as a visual reminder that these medications should not be used without a doctor's prescription.⁶ The campaign was accompanied by awareness materials in 12 regional languages and integration with the broader National Action Plan on Antimicrobial Resistance (NAP-AMR).⁷\nDespite international recognition of the Red Line campaign as an innovative public health intervention,⁸ systematic evaluation of its impact on AMR trends has been limited. Previous studies have focused on awareness levels among healthcare professionals and the public, with concerning findings—only 7% of healthcare workers could accurately describe the red line's significance.⁹ However, no study has utilized national surveillance data to characterize AMR trends during the campaign era.\nThe Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) established the Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Network (AMRSN) in 2013, which now includes 30 tertiary care centers across India.¹⁰ This network provides the most comprehensive national data on resistance patterns for WHO priority pathogens. The present study aimed to characterize AMR trends during the Red Line campaign era (2016-2024) using interrupted time series (ITS) analysis of ICMR-AMRSN surveillance data, providing the first systematic evaluation of resistance trajectories during this critical policy period.\nMaterials and Methods\nStudy Design and Data Sources\nThis retrospective analytical study utilized publicly available secondary data from the ICMR-AMRSN annual reports spanning 2016-2024. We consolidated data from three complementary datasets: (1) an epidemiology dataset containing 52 records with regional resistance patterns and antimicrobial agent-specific data; (2) a molecular dataset with 46 records containing resistance gene prevalence data; and (3) a granular dataset with 38 records containing center-specific mortality and clinical outcome data. Together, these yielded 120 unique center-year observations.\nData extraction was performed from official ICMR-AMRSN annual reports using systematic digitization protocols. The primary outcome was the mean resistance percentage, defined as the proportion of isolates demonstrating phenotypic resistance to tested antimicrobials. We focused on WHO priority pathogens: Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Acinetobacter baumannii, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).\nData Processing and Standardization\nResistance percentages were extracted using a custom natural language processing pipeline to parse text strings (e.g., "57% Imipenem resistant") into numerical values. Pathogen names were standardized to a common taxonomy. Annual aggregates were calculated as the mean resistance percentage across all observations within each calendar year, weighted equally regardless of sample size to avoid bias toward larger centers.\nStatistical Analysis: Interrupted Time Series\nInterrupted time series (ITS) analysis with segmented regression was used to model temporal trends.¹¹ The regression model was specified as:\nY_t = β₀ + β₁(Time) + β₂(Intervention) + β₃(Time_After) + ε_t\nWhere Y_t is the mean resistance percentage at time t, β₀ is the intercept, β₁ represents the pre-intervention slope, β₂ captures the immediate level change at intervention, and β₃ represents the change in slope post-intervention. Since the available surveillance data begins in 2016 (the intervention year), β₁ and β₃ estimates should be interpreted as characterizing the trend during the campaign period rather than comparing pre- and post-intervention trajectories.\nAutocorrelation was assessed using the Durbin-Watson statistic, with values near 2.0 indicating no autocorrelation.¹² Sensitivity analyses included: (1) pathogen-specific models for each WHO priority organism; and (2) exclusion of COVID-19 pandemic years (2020-2021) to assess potential confounding. All analyses were conducted using Python 3.12 with statsmodels 0.14. Statistical significance was set at α=0.05.\nResults\nTemporal Trends in Antimicrobial Resistance\nA total of 120 center-year observations were consolidated across nine years (2016-2024). Table 1 presents annual resistance trends. Mean resistance increased from 14.0% in 2016 (N=2 observations) to a peak of 61.1% in 2021 (N=31 observations), with subsequent stabilization at 53.5% in 2024 (N=10 observations). The number of observations increased substantially over time, reflecting expansion of the AMRSN network.\nFigure 1 illustrates the study design and data flow. Figure 2 presents the main ITS plot showing the observed and fitted resistance trends during the campaign period.\n[TABLE 1 HERE - Annual AMR Trends 2016-2024]\nInterrupted Time Series Analysis\nThe segmented regression model demonstrated a statistically significant temporal trend (Table 2). The estimated annual increase in mean resistance was 2.51% per year (95% CI: 1.09-3.94, p=0.004). The model explained 71.3% of variance in resistance rates (R²=0.71). The Durbin-Watson statistic was 0.56, suggesting some positive autocorrelation that warrants cautious interpretation.\nFigure 2 displays the observed data points, fitted regression line, and counterfactual scenario assuming the 2016 rate remained constant. The divergence between the fitted trend and counterfactual illustrates the magnitude of resistance accumulation during the study period.\n[TABLE 2 HERE - ITS Regression Coefficients]\nSensitivity Analyses\nPathogen-specific analyses revealed heterogeneous trends (Table 3, Figure 3). E. coli showed a significant annual increase of +1.26%/year (p=0.048). MRSA demonstrated a stronger increase of +2.97%/year (p=0.035). A. baumannii showed the steepest trajectory (+6.73%/year), though this did not reach statistical significance (p=0.073), likely due to fewer data points (N=6 years). K. pneumoniae showed near-flat trends (+0.27%/year, p=0.848).\nExcluding COVID-19 years (2020-2021) strengthened the observed trend, with an annual increase of +3.49%/year (p=0.001). This suggests that the pandemic period introduced variability but did not fundamentally alter the underlying trend. Figure 4 presents a forest plot summarizing sensitivity analyses.\n[TABLE 3 HERE - Sensitivity Analyses]\nDiscussion\nThis study provides the first systematic characterization of antimicrobial resistance trends during India's Red Line campaign era using national surveillance data. Our findings reveal a significant and sustained increase in mean resistance rates from 14.0% in 2016 to 53.5% in 2024, with an estimated annual increase of 2.51% per year. These trends persisted across pathogen-specific analyses, with particularly concerning trajectories for A. baumannii and MRSA.\nThe interpretation of these findings requires careful consideration. First, the absence of robust pre-2016 surveillance data precludes a true pre-post comparison. It is possible that resistance was increasing even more rapidly before the campaign, and the observed trends represent a relative deceleration. Second, the Red Line campaign was one component of a broader national strategy including the NAP-AMR, antimicrobial stewardship programs, and infection control initiatives.¹³ Attributing resistance trends to any single intervention is methodologically challenging.\nOur findings align with global patterns of rising AMR. The GRAM study documented increasing resistance across most WHO priority pathogens, with the highest burden in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa.¹ India's position as the world's largest antibiotic consumer,⁴ combined with factors such as agricultural antibiotic use, environmental contamination, and gaps in sewage treatment,¹⁴ creates a complex epidemiological context that awareness campaigns alone may not address.\nThe heterogeneity observed across pathogens is particularly informative. The relatively stable trends for K. pneumoniae (the WHO's "urgent" priority pathogen) may reflect the impact of targeted carbapenem stewardship efforts in intensive care settings.¹⁵ Conversely, the steep rise in A. baumannii resistance highlights this organism's notorious ability to acquire and disseminate resistance mechanisms, particularly in hospital environments.¹⁶\nPrevious evaluations of the Red Line campaign have focused on awareness metrics. A 2022 study found that only 7% of healthcare professionals could correctly describe the red line's significance, and awareness among patients was virtually absent.⁹ Our findings complement these observations by demonstrating that, regardless of awareness levels, resistance continues to rise. This suggests that awareness alone is insufficient—enforcement of prescription requirements, pharmacist training, and penalties for over-the-counter antibiotic sales may be necessary.\nComparison with other national interventions is instructive. China's 2012 National Special Rectification Activities for Clinical Antibiotics demonstrated significant reductions in antibiotic prescribing, with ITS analysis showing immediate decreases in antibiotic percentage and sustained slope changes.¹⁷ However, China's intervention included mandatory restrictions and hospital-level accountability, whereas India's Red Line campaign relies primarily on voluntary compliance.\nSeveral limitations warrant acknowledgment. First, the data begins at the intervention year (2016), precluding estimation of true pre-intervention trends. Second, the low Durbin-Watson statistic (0.56) suggests positive autocorrelation, which may inflate standard errors and affect statistical inference. Third, the aggregation of diverse pathogens, antibiotics, and clinical settings into a single metric may obscure important heterogeneity. Fourth, surveillance data quality and completeness varied across years and centers. Despite these limitations, this represents the most comprehensive longitudinal analysis of Indian AMR trends during the campaign era.\nConclusions\nAntimicrobial resistance rates in India increased significantly during the Red Line campaign era (2016-2024), with an estimated annual increase of 2.5% per year. While this does not definitively indicate campaign failure—given the absence of pre-intervention baseline data—it underscores that awareness campaigns alone are insufficient to reverse AMR trends. A multi-pronged approach integrating stronger regulatory enforcement, antimicrobial stewardship programs, pharmacist education, surveillance expansion, and addressing upstream drivers such as agricultural antibiotic use and environmental contamination is urgently needed. Future studies should leverage longer time series with pre-intervention data to enable robust impact evaluation.\nAcknowledgments\nWe acknowledge the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and the Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Network (AMRSN) for making annual surveillance reports publicly available.
