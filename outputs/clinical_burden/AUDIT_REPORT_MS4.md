**Target Journal:** IJMR Research Brief

## REVIEWER 1: Epidemiologist / Public Health Expert

### Overall Assessment
**Recommendation:** Accept with Minor Revisions

The manuscript provides valuable surveillance synthesis on AMR clinical burden. The declining mortality trend is noteworthy.

### Critical Issues
1. **Sample Size Clarification (MODERATE)**
   - N=14 surveillance data points is low; clarify this represents aggregated network data, not individual patients
   - Recommend adding: "These 14 data points represent aggregate outcomes from surveillance networks covering >39 hospitals"

2. **Ecological Fallacy Warning (MODERATE)**
   - Add explicit statement: "As aggregate surveillance data, individual patient-level outcomes cannot be inferred"

### Minor Issues
3. **Confidence Intervals**
   - Table 1 lacks confidence intervals for mortality estimates
   - Consider adding where calculable

4. **Temporal Trend Causality**
   - Declining mortality claim needs caveat about potential confounders (COVID-19 impact, reporting changes)

## REVIEWER 2: Clinical Microbiologist / ID Specialist

### Overall Assessment
**Recommendation:** Accept with Minor Revisions

Clinically relevant analysis highlighting critical resistance patterns. Some technical refinements needed.

### Critical Issues
1. **Resistance Definition Clarity (MODERATE)**
   - Specify: Are these ICU-specific rates or hospital-wide?
   - Clarify breakpoint standards used (CLSI vs EUCAST) for each year

2. **Colistin Susceptibility Gap (MODERATE)**
   - Given high carbapenem resistance, colistin susceptibility data would strengthen clinical utility
   - If unavailable, acknowledge as limitation

### Minor Issues
3. **A. baumannii Clinical Implications**
   - Expand on why A. baumannii resistance is particularly concerning (limited treatment options, environmental persistence)

4. **Stewardship Recommendations**
   - Strengthen with specific actionable recommendations (e.g., carbapenem-sparing protocols, rapid diagnostics)
