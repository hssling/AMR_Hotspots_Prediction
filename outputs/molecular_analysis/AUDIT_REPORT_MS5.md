## REVIEWER 1: Molecular Biologist

### Overall Assessment
**Recommendation:** Accept with Revisions
The paper provides a decent overview of resistance genes, but lacks depth in discussing *co-resistance* mechanisms and the implications of specific variants.

### Critical Issues
1. **Gene Co-occurrence:** 
   - The results mention "co-occurrence" but don't quantify it well. Can you explicitly state the % of isolates with *both* NDM and OXA-48? This is critical for choosing combination therapies.
2. **Variant Specificity:**
   - Mentions "blaNDM" broadly. Is it NDM-1, NDM-5, etc.? If the data doesn't distinguish, this must be a limitation.
3. **MCR-1 Silence:**
   - The discussion mentions *mcr* genes as a threat but doesn't clarify if they were *tested for* and not found, or not tested. This distinction matters for the colistin susceptibility claim.
4. **PCR vs WGS:**
   - Methods should clarify if data is from PCR-based surveillance or WGS. ICMR usually uses PCR for specific targets. This is a methodological limitation compared to full WGS.

### Minor Issues
- **Figure 1**: Ensure the heatmap color scale is clearly defined.
- **Reference 17**: Check if 2008 reference is the most current for defining ESBLs.

## REVIEWER 2: Infectious Disease Specialist

### Overall Assessment
**Recommendation:** Accept with Revisions
Clinical implications are strong, but the translational aspect could be sharper.

### Critical Issues
1. **Therapeutic Implications (Discussion):**
   - You mention aztreonam-avibactam. Please elaborate on *why* this works for NDM+OXA-48 (aztreonam for NDM, avibactam for ESBL/OXA protection). This mechanism is key for readers.
2. **Fosfomycin Reporting:**
   - Fosfomycin susceptibility is high (>95%), but is this for *urinary* isolates (E. coli) only? Systemic fosfomycin use is controversial/limited. Clarify if these are urinary or blood isolates.
3. **Stewardship/Diagnostics:**
   - Add a recommendation for *molecular* rapid diagnostics in the conclusion. "Phenotypic testing takes 48h; molecular takes 2h." Emphasize this lead-time advantage.

### Minor Issues
- **A. baumannii**: Emphasize that *minocycline* is a viable option given the 50-70% susceptibility, often overlooked.
- **Title**: "2017-2024" is a long range. Consider if trends shifted pre/post-COVID. (Already noted in MS4, maybe brief mention here).
